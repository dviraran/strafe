# strafe

STRAFE is a novel architecture we developed for modeling time-series clinical data and predicting time-to-event. The STRAFE algorithm was applied to real-world claims data using the OMOP common data model format.
The STRAFE architecture design is an expansion of SARD, a Trasnformer-based architecture developed by Kodiolam et al. [1], which takes as input time-series OMOP CDM data that was built from claims data to predict clinical outcomes.

This repository includes the implemenation of the STRAFE algorithm from the pre-process phase until the prediction phase. We also included the implementation of SARD and logistic regression for risk prediction and the survival baselines: random survival forest (RSF) [2] and DeepHit [3].

The expansion of the SARD model to time-to-event prediction was inspired by Hu at al. [4].

We described the details of this method and the STRAFE architecture in our paper. If you use STRAFE in your work, please cite our paper:

## Documentation
Most of the scripts and code in this repository was taken from omop-learn package: github.com/clinicalml/omop-learn.
This include some exceptions. Every function which is differ from the original is marked with the comment: "# Changed" before function definition.
Thus, for most of the code a a more detailed summary and documentation can be found in omop-learn package.

The following files are code scripts to run the models:
- prediction_preprocess.py : reading information from cohort, creating feature set and save datasets for further analysis (risk/surv)
- risk.py: running SARD and logistic regression model for risk tasks.
- surv.py: running STRAFE, DeepHit and RSF for time-to-event prediction and risk prediction as described in the paper.
- survival.py: transformer-based Kaplan-Meier estimator (Hu. at al)
- sql/Cohorts/cohort_survival.py: implementation the cohort defined in the paper.
